# SORTING RULES
# Each line you type is a new constraint you add for sorting your inventory.
# After any change, just press the sorting key to reload the settings. Some examples:
# * "A1 sword" puts any sword in row A, column 1 (see grid below)
# * "A edibleFood" fills the A row with food
# * "1 ironPickaxe" fills the 1 column with an iron pickaxe
# * "A1-C4 blocks" fills the rectangle with any blocks
# * "B LOCKED" avoids items from row B to move out of it when sorting

# INVENTORY GRID

# AVAILABLE KEYWORDS
# Open the 'InvTweaksTree.txt' file for a list of available keywords. If an item

# or create a rule by ID. Examples: "A5 203", "C9 12345-13"
